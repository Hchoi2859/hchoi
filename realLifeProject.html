      <h2>what is real-life project?</h2>
      <p>I was fortunate enough to be recommended by a professor for a Management Information Systems class, which involved a real-life project. The project was assigned to a group of four to five people, and was provided by a company seeking our assistance. Our objective was to create an algorithm that would aid the company in selecting which contracts to pursue. We had to use a set of Excel functions to automate the processing of large sets of contract opportunity data, prioritize factors that aligned with the company's core competencies, and leverage their insights in order to allow the company, called FedWriters, to review and select contracts in a more efficient, standardized, and timely manner.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I created a list of funding offices that the company contracts with and
            a list of keywords that match the company's core competencies. The
            function I created identifies whether the description of a contract
            contains any of the keywords in the list and whether the funding office
            has previously had a contract with the client or not. This is because
            the more contracts a funding office has done with the client, the higher
            the chance of trust and certainty. If the company discovers more
            keywords and funding office, they can easily add them to the lis

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>        This sheet will automatically show the points for each contract once the
            company's information is entered. The higher the total points, the
            higher the chance that the company will select the contract. To access
            this information, all they have to do is scroll down to where they
            inputted the information on the original sheet.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        This criteria allows the user to select the weight among four factors
        because everyone's perspective toward each factor might be different.
        This helps them to evaluate the contract more fairly and accurately
        </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Final output:</h3>
      <img src="Real-Life/pp1.png" alt="pic1" />
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each column should be colored red, yellow, or green based on the total
        points corresponding to the weighted amount that the user has entered.
        However, I am unable to provide any output as it may contain
        confidential information related to the company's contract. As a result,
        the output is blinded to conceal the confidential information.
