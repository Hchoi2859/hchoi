      <p>
        I recently graduated from
        George Mason university located in Fairfax, Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m majoring in information system and operation management I’m an
        international student who are seeking IT Business position and have many
        experiences such as projects and volunteer. I learned some basic
        programming through classes I have taken such as python, HTML, CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL However, I learned by myself because I recognized its widespread use
        in companies that deal with databases. So I do know the CRUD (create,
        read update, delete) process. In addition, I have taken a course that
        focuses on creating websites, where I gained knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
        some JavaScript. I created a website using a combination of HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript for the last project. And finally I created choropleth
        map using python by extracting Covid-data that identifies number of
        cases across all county and states in the US too.
